## Known Limitations

- This API does not include authentication and authorization mechanisms. Consider implementing them for production use.

## Setup and Deployment

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2. git clone https://github.com/vhee4/HngTaskTwo.git

3. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.

4. Configure the application

The configuration for this API is stored in the `application.properties` file. To configure the API or make changes to its behavior, you can edit this file. Here's how:

- Navigate to the directory where the `application.properties` file is located.

- Open `application.properties` in a text editor of your choice.

- Modify the configuration settings as needed. Common configurations include database connection details, server port, or API secret keys.

Example `application.properties`:

  # Database configuration
    server.port = PORT
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
    spring.datasource.username=username
    spring.datasource.password=password

5. Package your application in a jar file using

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn install package
```

6. Run the package by using the jar application file found in the target folder:

7. java -jar your-application.jar
